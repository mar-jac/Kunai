# kunai
A student management system. Site: https://kunai-app.herokuapp.com/

This is a school management system that uses
[Django](https://www.google.com/search?client=opera&q=django+admin&sourceid=opera&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8) to 
do most of the work of managing students, fee submissions, teacher records etc..

Setting up Easy School is very easy.
## Want to Use?
You can clone this branch and use it right now using any of the methods mentioned below

## Building

It is best to use the python `virtualenv` tool to build locally:

```bash
> virtualenv venv
> source venv/bin/activate
> git clone https://github.com/mar-jac/kunai .
```
Then you navigate to the base directory of the project and install the requirements in your virtual environment

```bash
> cd easy-school/easy-school
> pip install -r requirements.txt
```
And finally you make migrations to the database, create a super user, and run the server
```bash
> python manage.py makemigrations
> python manage.py migrate
> python manage.py createsuperuser
> python manage.py runserver
```

Then visit `http://localhost:8000` to view the app. Alternatively you
can use foreman and gunicorn to run the server locally

```bash
> foreman start
```
## Building with Docker
First run `docker-compose` to build the container:

```bash
docker-compose build
```

Then, run the following command to create the superuser:

```bash
docker-compose run web python manage.py createsuperuser
```

Finally, the Docker container can be launched with the following command:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

The server should be responding at 127.0.0.1:8000


Or you can also set this up in Heroku: https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/deploying-python
